# sentiment-Analysis-on-amazon-reviews
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) text preprocessing techniques and an XGBoost model. The goal is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in the reviews based on their textual content.

# Key Features
**NLP Text Preprocessing:** 
Utilizes techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization to prepare textual data for analysis.

**Feature Engineering:** 
Includes advanced text features like n-grams, sentiment lexicons, and syntactic parsing for richer representation of review content.

**XGBoost Model:** 
Implements the XGBoost algorithm, a robust gradient boosting technique, for sentiment classification. It supports efficient handling of sparse data and is scalable for large datasets.

**Cross-Validation: **
Incorporates cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalize the model's performance on unseen data.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Optimizes XGBoost model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to improve classification accuracy.
